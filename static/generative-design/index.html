        I will write a generative design script
      </h1>
      <p>I will help you use the power of computers to create procedurally generated art. I won’t provide you with a single masterpiece, I cannot do that, instead when talking about generative design you always get a (potentially infinite) collection of related artworks produced by computer.</p>
      <p>This article lists different use-cases and concepts of generative/procedural design. It also includes a few adjacent topics that are commonly used simultaneously. Each section also contains an example of my work in this category, so that you can better imagine what is possible.</p>

      <h2 id="purpose-of-generative-design">Purpose of the Generative Design</h2>
      <p>Procedural design often tackles a combination of all three mentioned purposes. For example: A live visualization that takes in current weather conditions and use it to control simulation of clouds in the background.</p>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <h3 id="art">Art</h3>
      <p>First and foremost, it’s most commonly presented as art. So its purpose is to express emotions, tell stories.</p>
      <div class="example-bar">
        <img src="media/purpose-art.png" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="visualize">Visualize</h3>
      <p>However, generative art can be utilized also for other means. For example to visually represent the significance of data to the viewer. As visual content is processed much faster and easier than text or a spreadsheet full of data it’s advantageous to let a computer generate visual representations for them.</p>
      <div class="example-bar">
        <img src="media/purpose-visualize.png" class="w-80" />
      </div>
      <h3 id="simulate">Simulate</h3>
      <p>Another related field is simulation and modeling. Its aim is to copy physical properties and visually understand complex systems by building their approximations - models.</p>
      <div class="example-bar">
        <img src="media/purpose-simulate.png" class="w-80" />

      <h2 id="media-used-by-generative-design">Media used by Generative Design</h2>
      <h3 id="image-and-video">Image and video</h3>
      <p>The most commonly used media in generative design are without a doubt images and video.</p>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">

        </div>
        <p>To show this output format I have choosen a very simple animation generated by a computer.</p>
        <div class="show-video-print-image">
          <img src="media/output-image.png" />
          <video src="media/output-image.mp4" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted" />

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="d-objects">3D objects</h3>
      <p>Rendering tools became very powerful over the years. And in combination with generative design they can produce visually appealing and complex scenes.</p>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="golden-cards-2021">Golden cards (2021)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Here, I made a collection of procedurally generated 3D models. I used a modeling software Blender and a script which builds the scene and then renders it. Each card here represents a topic that people talked about at a given day.</p>
        <p><img class="w-80" src="media/output-3d.png" /></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="games-and-virtual-worlds">Games and virtual worlds</h3>
      <p>The most well known example of this approach is Minecraft. I can provide you with a procedurally generated world for your game. Or it can be used as a content to fill the background of your scenes. For example an generated cityscape.</p>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="infinite-procedural-worlds-2015">Infinite procedural worlds (2015)</h4>

        </div>
        <p>The next example is in an old procedurally generated world of mine. It's built using a recursive of galaxies, planets, their terrains, and trees. User interface allows you to view the world on any zoom level and it's infinite in both x and y directions.</p>

      <h3 id="installations">Installations</h3>
      <p>Generative design can be also used in the manufacturing process of an object. For example CNC Machining or 3D printing can be easily controlled by a computer following a generative script.</p>
      <p>I do not (yet) have an example of this usage of generative design, but hopefully I will soon.</p>

      <h2 class="c20 c26" id="h.dz3cuyhj4yxi"><span class="c1">Generative Design concepts</span></h2>
      <h3 id="parameterization">Parameterization</h3>
      <p>I htink that the most important concept of generative design is parameterization. Script can use input parameters (for example width of the image, numbef or fish) and using them calculate location, shape, color, and movement of objects on the screen. You should be then able to tweak parameters to produce many differnet art pieces.</p>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="ponyo-animation-2016">“Ponyo” animation (2016)</h4>
          <a class="btn-source" href="https://github.com/dee-gmiterko/processing-sketches/tree/master/ponyo">&lt;/&gt; Browse source code</a>
        </div>
        <p>If you watch this example closely you can notice that it's only using a single math function. sin(x). But when it's applied to basic properties of objects like position, rotation, and color it can still produce complex looking results.</p>
        <div class="show-video-print-image">
          <img src="media/parameterization.png" />
          <div class="parameterization-videos">
            <video src="media/parameterization-a.mp4" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted"></video>
            <video src="media/parameterization-b.mp4" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted"></video>
            <video src="media/parameterization-c.mp4" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted"></video>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="repeatability">Repeatability</h3>
      <p>I think the second most important concept of procedural design is repeatability. Idea of this content is really straightforward: Given a script (source code) and inputs users can always generate the same artwork. So this means you do not have to store generated media as it can be always reproduced. Or you can still choose to produce new artworks by altering its code or inputs.</p>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="fern-profile-picture-2022">Fern profile picture (2022)</h4>
          <a class="btn-source" href="https://github.com/dee-gmiterko/processing-sketches/tree/master/interactive-fern">&lt;/&gt; Browse source code</a>
        </div>
        <p>I decided to demonstrate this concept on this simple “profile picture generator”. Given a name it will produce an image composed of fern leaves to represent the name.</p>
        <p><img src="media/repeatability.png" /></p>
        <p class="text-center"><a class="btn-source" href="https://interactive-fern.netlify.app/">Try it out for yourself</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="randomness">Randomness</h3>
      <p>A very important concept for generative art is randomness. It can be used to alter input parameters of the generative process to produce a varied collection of artworks or assets.</p>
      <p>You can use this concept to produce many unique but visually similar items. For example a lot of different rocks for a game, a collection of card decks where each package is slightly different, or now-so-popular NFT collections.</p>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="a-tri-tree-2016">A tri-tree (2016)</h4>
          <a class="btn-source" href="https://github.com/dee-gmiterko/processing-sketches/tree/master/sketch_161006d">&lt;/&gt; Browse source code</a>
        </div>
        <p>In this example I am using a stream of random numbers to place new leaves forming tree-like structures in a process.</p>
        <p><img src="media/random-tree.png" /></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="transformation">Transformation</h3>
      <p>Another approach to procedural art is not to fully generate the media by yourself but instead take some existing content as an input and only transform it in a way. You can take things like images, videos, text, numbers, datasets and use a deterministic script to produce new content. For example by doing geometric transformations, color modifications, abstraction, or simplification.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="album-mood-2018">Album mood (2018)</h4>
          <a class="btn-source" href="https://github.com/dee-gmiterko/2d-color-picker/">&lt;/&gt; Browse source code</a>
        </div>
        <p>To demonstrate this concept I choose a project that turns a series of photos (for example a gallery or video) into an abstract image containing a color palette that best represents the original images. This example uses statistical methods and other math magic to extract the relevant information.</p>
        <div class="show-video-print-image">
          <img src="media/transformation.png" />
          <video src="media/transformation.webm" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</h3>
      <p>A very current technique used to solve many problems across the board is artificial intelligence. And of course, it can be applied also to generative art.</p>
      <p>An artificial intelligence is quite successfully used to solve specific problems like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>generating a collection of similar objects (e.g anime characters) given a set of examples</li>
        <li>generating images from a text description</li>
        <li>image restoration, upscaling</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="grow"></div>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="style-transfer-2017">Style transfer (2017)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>For example here I used a neural network to color in a picture for me given a silhouette and a style to match.</p>
        <p><img src="media/artificial-intelligence.png" /></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <h3 id="visualization">Visualization</h3>
      <p>A specific case of transformations are data visualizations. We can treat real world data as an input into a procedural design script. But in this case its purpose isn't an artistic expression, but a representation of information.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="geocache-density-2019">Geocache density (2019)</h4>
          <a class="btn-source" href="https://github.com/dee-gmiterko/cacheviz">&lt;/&gt; Browse source code</a>
        </div>
        <p>For example here I used a heatmap view, and various plots to describe distribution of caches and their visits for a game played in the real world, Geocaching. I am sure you have encountered many visualizations in your life, so I don’t have to explain their capabilities.</p>
        <p><img class="w-80" src="media/visualization.png" /></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <!--
      <h3 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h3>
      <p>Use of physical devices is also common in generative design. Any external input like mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, microphone, temperature sensor, or just anything that can respond to the physical world can be used to alter the output. This creates an immersive experience for people viewing the artwork.</p>
      -->
      <h3 id="simulation">Simulation</h3>
      <p>And the last concept used in a generative design I can think of is simulation. This can include physics simulation, flow of fluids, or discrete agents interacting with each other.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">
          <h4 id="sheep-herding-simulation-2017">Sheep herding simulation (2017)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>I have prepared this simulation using very few simple rules which jointly produce a complex behavior. In this case we have three basic rules:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>sheep alter their heading to match other sheep nearby</li>
        <li>sheep runs away from a dog</li>
        <li>dog tries to preserve a fixed distance from closest sheep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And their interaction forces sheep to create a herd every single time even though it is not directly specified anywhere.</p>
