      <Page title="Website development">
        <p>
          Websites are the most common way to present information on the internet. And I have experience with building many different kinds of them. Blogs, static, eshops, internal applications, you name it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their development is commonly split into two parts, frontend (what users sees in their browser) and backend (what happens on the server). I've worked on both.

          Later during my studies at MUNI I've joined InQool in a part time capacity:

        <p>
          It's one thing to work on a closed order like an eshop that is more or less built and delivered once. But it's a whole different story to has a little bit of sway on a constantly evolving product while it's being used by thousands of people.

            As a link between server platform underneat and the data processing scripts on top, it's a great tool for managing data workflows. At this time I've been using it a lot in order to:

      <Page title="Freelance development">
        <p>
          Working in a freelance capacity, not being bound by constraints of a single company, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects. But it also means I had to wear many hats each day. I have done everything from gathering requirements, designing, developing, testing, deploying, maintaining, supporting, to accounting. Wearing all the hats is not always easy, but it's definitely a great way to learn your limits.
