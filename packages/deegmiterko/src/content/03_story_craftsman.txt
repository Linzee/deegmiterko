$title: The era of the "craftsman"
The first one encompasses my childhood.
As I already mentioned, there wasn't much to do in my hometown. So I had to entertain myself. Which I did- by crafting and creating stuff.
You: What did you create?
I was a kid at that point. So sister and I built towns, made up board games, performed theatre performances,... just about anything.
I remember building stupidly complex buildings and entire towns out of toys and Lego. For example, this bridge of cards.

Very soon after getting access to a computer, I realized that you could make anything üôå on it if you spent enough time there.
You: So you are well prepared for the virtual future üòÅ
Yes, it is only getting more powerful, and since the emergence of the internet, opportunities only surged.

Anyway, I would think up something totally awesome (or so I thought at the time) and attempt to create it. Those included art, games, websites, tools, mods and levels for existing games.
You: That sounds like a lot of stuff.
Yes, it was. But this was a time when I learned how to work on stuff, fueled by passion.
Are you able to show me some of those personal projects?
You can browse them on a website from back then. But many of the projects remain unfinished.
