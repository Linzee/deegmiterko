$title: The era of the "engineer"
The next era on my list commenced when I was offered my [first and second jobs, enrolled in a university](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-gmiterko), and joined some societies. I started working with/for other people, so my goals changed significantly.

Only then did I learn how to get things done.
You: What's the difference between creating and getting things done?
A big difference ðŸ˜ƒ
When you are just creating, you rarely finish the thing because you can always find something to tweak on a project and never truly complete it.
You: ðŸ˜‰ Yes, I know the feeling when it's still not good enough to publish and conclude.
Exactly. So in this era of my life, I learned to cut corners, not work on things that don't make a difference in the end, and to fail fast.
You: That's a good thing because a finished task is always better than perfect but unfinished.

You: What projects did you work on during this era?
Because I worked as a developer, a part of a team, I am unsure whether I can disclose any specific projects. But I had to learn to rely on others, share knowledge, and ask for help. So that was a great experience.
You: What did you do outside the work?
Besides the work and my student responsibilities, I spent my time on large team efforts -- competitions, conventions, and festivals, to name a few.

It's a funny feeling when the satisfaction of many people depends on you. Many people have never experienced this and I think that it's a shame. ðŸ˜€
You: Why?
Working on a large project you realize that things never go according to plan and you have to improvise and put out fires.
