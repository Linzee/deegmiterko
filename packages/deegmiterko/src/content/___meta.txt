Chapter stories:

I've always been an artist, one way or another.

| Artist // Art, (it's media)
|   "new media adds new ways to express oneself"
|   Physical > "paper" > digital > virtual / audiovisual > infinite-space

..

| Tie-in of art and tech // Generative Design
|   "A bottom up, additive design"

..continuation, once you put them together you can create something new, convey a message you couldn't before

| Puhshing the limits // Games and Experiments
|   "Puhshing the limits"
|   Games were always pushing the boundaries of what is possible. All in the persuit of telling a story, or creating an unforgetable experience.

Only once we find that something works, we can start to build on it.

$scramble you: I think that's actually very clever.

Which is where my professional experience comes in.

you: Where have you worked?

| Professional // Professional (AKA "real job")
|   "Given, I also had to work in a professional capacity"
|   Working with others may provide it's own challenges, but it's essential to scale the things you can do well beyond what you could do alone.

Given, those are much more difficult to share beyond listing it, as they are often non-public and non-visual.

you: Yes, I do get that.

I still hope you gained some insight into what I did and what could be in my capabilities.

| Dee Gmiterko // Me (Coder | Artist | Me)
|   "I exist outside of work, too"
|   Top 5 places where to find me
|   -- alternate --
|   4 slides, 3 photos each, 

Then, there is *Me*.

you: Nice to meet *You*.

M: Okay, hear me out,
M: projects + short conversatione exceprpts on timeline: 
A: Okay
M: Okay, hear me out again,
M: Tell the story as a "series of sessions" with in-advance made slides. [[[ D-D-D Done ]]]
  - each session should be prefaced with a day of a week, to signify flow of time
  - "lecture slides", introductory slide that it moves out of automatically
A: Okay
M: Okay, what about a stamp "Made by D[ee] Gmiterko"? [[[ D-D-D Done ]]]
A: Maybe?
M: Hey! What if we gave no replies? We can scramble and blur the responses. [While keeping it solveable.. use some stupid font (e.g. minecraft rune)/cypher]
A: I think that's actually very clever. Giving voice back to the observer.
