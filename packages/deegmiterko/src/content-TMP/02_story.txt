$title: Life story so far
You: So. Can you tell me a little bit about your's life story?
My name is Dominik Gmiterko, born and raised in a small town, Slovakia, Central Europe.
Only when I left it and moved abroad did I realize just how tiny the town was and how many options to clasp lie elsewhere.
You: Ahm
You could say that the common theme of my life so far was searching for options. As I enjoy the feeling when I am facing many possibilities.
You: We got so deep, so quickly.
ðŸ˜… you are right. Let's step back a bit.

Do you know how you sometimes realize things only when you have to explain them to someone?.
You: Yes, definitely.
Once, on a walk with a friend, I realized that you could split my life into a couple of eras. Each of them has its own goals, interests, and circumstances.
You: How many eras did you go through?
I think three so far.
