$title: Annoying qualities
[TODO] segway

Let's get back to my questions.
I have couple more prepared.

You: What do you value?

creativity
finding solutions for useful problems

I value people who can actually do stuff. Because having ideas and talking about them is easy, but really doing something is much harder. I do not care of you succeed or not as long as you are trying. You can learn a lot even when your attempt does not yield the expected results.

You: How I look at problems
break down complex problems into smaller components and their dependencies
I tend to visualize them in my notebook. Because this allows me to grasp larger problems and find possible issues others do not see. Multiple people told me I can think and see two steps ahead. but that it only thanks to my skills in visualizing complex problems.

You: How I learn
My approach to learning
read minimal viable amount of information and jump into some small project as soon as possible
to gather experience hands on
this means I will quickly face the most combing problems and challenges and only once I know why this has to be solved I look for solutions
this approach to learning produced many small personal projects that can be viewed on ___and on my GitHub account.

You: My blind spots
I may assume you know and understand more than you do. And then I will answer you with way too short message not explaining myself fully. Just please tell me that you still do not understand and I will be happy to spend more time explaining it.

You: Things I do that may annoy you
I may get lost sometimes. Literally. When I am overworked I sometimes want just to pick a backpack and get lost in the world to recharge my batteries. And I may loose communication to everyone. Just a friendly warning. It's best just to make sure I am okay and wait a bit.

You: How to work with me successfully
inform me about new facts and issues as soon as they emerge and have a regular meetings with me trying to solve those problems. Informing me immediately allows me to add this facts into my mental model and think about them for a while before acting on it

You: Personality traits
I love the process of creating new things. And if those things can help someone, even better. I like cooperating with people on projects leveraging my knowledge in many areas. [skill boxes link]
