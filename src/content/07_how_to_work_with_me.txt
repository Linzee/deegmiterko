$title: Annoying qualities
Let's get back to my questions. I have a couple more prepared.
You: How do you approach problems?
I usually start by learning as much as possible about the problem. Then I visualize it in my mind's eye or when the problem in front of me is truly complex I use a paper. Putting it down allows me to break down problems into smaller components and their dependencies.

Multiple people told me I can see two steps ahead. But I think it's only thanks to my skills in visualization.

You: How do you learn new skills?
My approach to learning is getting dirty as soon as possible. I read the least required amount of information and then jump into a project to try it head-on. Do you know how this ends?
How?
Well, quickly, by running into common obstacles for which I have to look up solutions. But then I know why I have to do it this way.

You: What do you do that annoys people around you?
Ha ðŸ˜€ Okay, sometimes I get lost without telling anyone where I went and when I will be back.
This happens when I am overwhelmed. When I get into this state I just want to pick a backpack and get lost in the world. Change of perspective allows me to recharge my batteries. But this often means I don't want to communicate to people who would keep me overwhelmed, so I may ignore you. Just a friendly warning ðŸ˜…
You: Thanks
But I always return and I am wiser for it.
