Hi!
You: Hi ðŸ‘‹
I was on a walk with friend and I realized something. That my life can be split into three or four eras.
You: Eras?
Yes,
I often figure out stuff only when I try to explain them to others so I have to devise them fully.
When I was trying to sum up my life up until this point I found out that it consisted of a few eras where I had common intentions and spend time focusing on single goal. And of course there is always an event that changed my pathway separating them.
