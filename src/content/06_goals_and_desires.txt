$title: Goals and desires

creating tools to help others
its something I always treasured.

# Current goal 1
Deciding to detach from owning physical stuff allowing me to move around and travel freely.
I don't need much stuff for my life.
Even a van would be enough.
Because have no desire to own cars or impress people with watches I can afford to instead invest most of my possessions into things I believe in.

# goal 1.1
Explore and really get to know the world we live in.
- experiencing other nations

# scale my actions 2

# Current goal 3
To create a business in secondhand clothing market.
Just a little bit more mainstream.
