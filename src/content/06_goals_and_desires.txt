$title: Goals and desires
You: What are the current goals you focus on?
I can share several of them with you. As discussed in the previous section, my immediate goal is to build a machine to scale me.
You: Okay, second..?
My second ambition is to detach from owning physical stuff allowing me to be more mobile and travel freely. For example in a van. You know, like a digital nomad. Because I crave getting to know the world we live in better and understanding the environment we made here on earth.
And also try to help people on my way. As I have no desire to own watches to impress people I can instead afford to invest my wealth into things I believe in.
You: That's nice ☺️
Creating tools to help others was something I always treasured and enjoyed.
You: Do you have any more goals?
One of the more concrete realizations of my desire to help people is to create a business in the secondhand clothing market. If I could make it just a little bit more mainstream I would be so delighted ☺️
