You: So. Can you tell me a little bit about yours life story?
My name is Dominik Gmiterko, born and raised in a small town, Slovakia, Central Europe.

Do you know how you sometimes realize things only when you have to explain them to someone?
Yes: Yes, definitely

You: How many eras did you go through?
I think three so far.
