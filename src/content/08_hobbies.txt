$title: Hobbies
You: Let's finish with a light topic.
You: What do you do to unwind? What are your hobbies?
The most calming thing I do to unravel is probably drawing. I can spend hours mindlessly layering hard pastels while the picture on the paper slowly approaches my vision.
Right there with it is walking, alone, with music in earbuds.
You: I also like to do that.
And in general discovering anything alternative, exciting, and new always drew me in. That is also why I tend to visit back alleys instead of tourist hotspots.
Then I am also fond of telling [stories](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwV05iipo9wIP_P2qpTWRw) I collected on my travels. People often tell me that I encouraged and inspired them to do more with those stories.
You: How are you usually connecting with people?
I am always open to getting to know new people wherever I walk. You can meet me going to a festival alone and finding new friends within minutes of arriving üòÅ
But I also keep up with my long-lasting friendships regularly, for example, by going for a beer.
You: Hopefully, we will get one day to a point where you invite me for a meetup üòâ
