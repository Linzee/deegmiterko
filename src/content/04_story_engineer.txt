$title: Era of the "engineer"

# Why

Then I was offered my [first and second jobs, enrolled to university](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-gmiterko/), and joined some societies.
So I started working with/for other people and my goals changed.

# What
Only then did I learn how to get things done.
You: What's the difference between creating and getting things done?
A big difference ðŸ˜ƒ
When you are just creating things you rarely finish them. You can always tweak or rework projects never truly getting them done.
You: ðŸ˜‰ yes, I definitely did stuff where I felt it's never good enough to publish.
Exactly. So in this era of my life I mostly learned to cut corners, not work on things that don't make a difference in the end, and to fail fast.
You: That's a good thing because a finished task is better that a one that is perfect but unfinished.

# How

For me this was very much a time to learn how to work with others
You: really?

This was first time I worked in team. So I had to rely on others, share knowledge, and ask for help.

- competitions (for example online team logic/puzzle/programming competition https://interlos.fi.muni.cz/)

- local festivals and conventions
Its a funny feeling when experience of many people depends on you. A lot of people never experience this and I think that its a shame. They could put their everyday problems into perspective if their mistake affected day of hundreds of people.

- and, you know, finishing projects instead of working at them ðŸ˜…
