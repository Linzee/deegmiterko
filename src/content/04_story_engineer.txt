$title: Era of the "engineer"

For me this was very much a time to learn how to work with others
You: really?

- working in teams

- competitions (for example online team logic/puzzle/programming competition https://interlos.fi.muni.cz/)

- local festivals and conventions
Its a funny feeling when experience of many people depends on you. A lot of people never experience this and I think that its a shame. They could put their everyday problems into perspective if their mistake affected day of hundreds of people.
[TODO] story

- and, you know, finishing projects ðŸ˜…
When I no longer made projects only for myself at some point I had to decide that it is done and instead of continuing on making it perfect. I haven't completed a task perfectly since ðŸ™‚
You: That's a good thing because a finished task is better that a one that is perfect but unfinished.

- explaining things to others
..its always better to spend few days teaching others at your team how to do stuff instead of trying to do everything yourself

This brings me to the last and current era of my life.
