$title: Era of the "craftsman"
The first one encompasses my childhood.

# Why

As I already mentioned there wasn't much to do in my home town. So I had to entertain myself. And I did it be crafting and creating stuff.
You: What did you create?
At first
 we sister board games, theatre performances
I remember building stupidly complex buildings and entire towns out of toys and Lego. For example this bridge out of cards.

# What

It was a time when I learned how to make stuff.

Then was when I realized I can make Anything ðŸ™Œ using computer if I spend enough time on it
extremely powerful tool

I would just think up something awesome (at that time) and attempt to create it.
This would include art, games, websites, tools, mods and levels for existing games, just about anything.

You can browse some of my "personal projects" on a website from back then:
