$title: Era of the "architect"
This brings me to the last and current era of my life. I am trying to scale my actions to have a greater impact.
You: How?
For example, in my full-time work, I am growing into a senior data engineer. In this tech lead position deciding the heading of our project, creating and prioritizing tasks is going to be one of my responsibilities.
Describing concepts and explaining problems soon became an inseparable part of my life. Because teaching others how to help you instead of doing everything yourself is always advantageous. Do you agree?
You: Yes.
I also started delegating tasks to others. For example, by using freelancer sites like Fiverr to outsource any tedious work.
And lastly, I started investing ðŸ˜… So I can profit a little bit from my knowledge as well as support projects and causes I believe in but cannot work on myself.
