$title: Era of the "architect"
This brings me to the last and current era of my life where I think I have recently arrived. But only time will tell.
I started to do things to scale my actions.

For example
senior data engineer

- delegating tasks to others.
For example by using freelancer sites like Fiverr to pass tedious tasks to others.
  [TODO?] story

- explaining things to others
..its always better to spend few days teaching others at your team how to do stuff instead of trying to do everything yourself

- tech lead
  make architecture decisions for the project, create and prioritize tasks

- investing
  - profit from my knowledge
- support projects and causes I believe in but cannot work on them myself
